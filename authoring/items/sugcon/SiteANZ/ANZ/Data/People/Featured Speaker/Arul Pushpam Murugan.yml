        I'm Arul Pushpam, and my journey in the professional world began in 2017. As a woman in this field, I've encountered numerous obstacles along the way. When I first embarked on my journey, I was far from being a proficient programmer. Comparing myself to others led me to believe I was lacking in various aspects. However, this perspective didn't serve me well.
        
        It was at this point that I was fortunate to find a mentor who illuminated the world of technology for me. Concurrently, I discovered Sitecore, a platform that intrigued me with its myriad features. Rather than comparing myself to others, I channeled my energy into learning and growing. Sitecore's capabilities captivated me, motivating me to delve deeper, learn more, and achieve more.
        
        As a result of my dedication, I proudly received my second MVP award this year. This journey has transformed me into a proficient programmer, a YouTuber, a blogger, and an enthusiastic knowledge sharer. I have a genuine passion for learning new features and, equally importantly, for disseminating my technical knowledge to the wider community.
        
        In my spare time, you'll find me eagerly exploring new technologies, refining my skills, and sharing my insights with fellow enthusiasts. I firmly believe that the tech community thrives on collaboration and shared learning. Every day presents new opportunities for growth, and I'm excited to embrace each one with enthusiasm.
