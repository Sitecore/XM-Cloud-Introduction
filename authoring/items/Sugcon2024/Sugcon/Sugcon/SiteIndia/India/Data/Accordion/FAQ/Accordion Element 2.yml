      Value: "<p>How does registration work?</p><p>This year's SUGCON India event is free to attend! While we have reserved spots for customers and partners, we've also made space available for those eager to join. If you're keen on attending but haven't received an invite, simply click on the 'Register Now' button at the top of the page and complete the form. We'll reach out to you after May 15th to confirm your selection. Please note that spots are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Once reserved, it's important to honour your commitment to attend. Failure to do so may result in being banned from future SUGCON events.&nbsp;</p>"
