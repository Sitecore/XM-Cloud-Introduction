        <h3>Can I become an MVP?</h3>
        <p>The Sitecore MVP Program is open for all individuals who work with the Sitecore platform and services. The key to be becoming an MVP is to share your expertise through online and offline channels. This could be by writing blog posts, giving presentations or webinars, and/or simply being active on our community platform or other channels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>How do I get invited?</h3>
        <p>Previously we operated an invitation and recommendation system. Currently we run the MVP applications without the need for invitation and recommendation in the name of inclusivity.</p>
        <p>Everything you need to apply is previous contribution to the community and a Sitecore ID. If you do not have a Sitecore ID you can <a href="https://www.sitecore.com/account/signup" title="Sitecore ID sign up" target="_blank">sign up on our website</a>. If you forgot your Sitecore ID password you can <a href="https://okta.sitecore.com/signin/forgot-password" title="Sitecore ID forgot password" target="_blank">reset it here</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>How do I fill in my application?</h3>
        <p>After you are invited you need to create an account and you can start by completing the MVP application form on the MVP website: <a href="https://mvp.sitecore.com/application">Sitecore MVP application</a></p>
        <p>Make sure you fill in the form as completely and detailed as possible and submit it before the deadline. All information will be used to review your nomination.</p>
