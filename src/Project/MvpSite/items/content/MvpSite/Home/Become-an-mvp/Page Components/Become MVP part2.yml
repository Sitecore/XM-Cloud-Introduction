        <h3>How do I invite or recommend someone?</h3>
        <p>Previously we operated an invitation and recommendation system. Currently we run the MVP applications without the need for invitation and recommendation in the name of inclusivity.</p>
        <p>Everything you need to apply is previous contribution to the community and a Sitecore ID. If you do not have a Sitecore ID you can <a href="https://www.sitecore.com/account/signup" title="Sitecore ID sign up" target="_blank">sign up on our website</a>. If you forgot your Sitecore ID password you can <a href="https://okta.sitecore.com/signin/forgot-password" title="Sitecore ID forgot password" target="_blank">reset it here</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What is the timeline of the selection process?</h3>
        <p>The nomination is open during November, for the exact dates please follow <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/SitecoreMVP" title="@SitecoreMVP" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SitecoreMVP</a>. We will review all the nominations and recommendations during December and we will finalize the award winners early January. The announcement of the Sitecore MVP Awards will be by the end of January.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What if I have additional questions?</h3>
        <p>If you have any additional questions about the Sitecore MVP Program or nominations please create a topic on the <a href="https://community.sitecore.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=671511531b357810486a4083b24bcb62" title="Sitecore Community Forum" target="_blank">General Discussion forums</a> or ask a question on <a href="https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mvp" title="Sitecore StackExchange" target="_blank">Sitecore StackExchange</a>.</p>
